# Network

This is the solution to my final assignment to my programming class at KIT. The main class `Network` allows to perform various operations on IP addresses arranged in a Forest (a set of trees). `Network` parses a description for trees of IP addresses in a lisp-like syntax and allows to perform various operations on its forest. For further information see the documentation in the source code.
